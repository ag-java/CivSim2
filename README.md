# CivSim2
A version 2 to my civilization simulator. New and improved! This version focuses more on politics/imperial interactions rather than resources (like the last one did). The prototype is built in Java with the Eclipse IDE and the final version was coded in Python.

## Use
To run the "production" version just type `python civsim2.py`
